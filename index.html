<h1>Introduction to Music Morals</h1>

<p>
  Music Morals aims to help the music industry move forward by showing different views on the same business-related topics. The insights we are providing are derived from different industry professionals, relevant to the topic. Understanding the mindset of an individual or company within the sector and the motivations behind their actions is crucial. Furthermore, we want to establish a framework for the industry to conduct business ethically. We discuss a wide range of topics, including fees, advances, percentages, terms, copyright, contracts, deal structures, and revenue splits. However, it is imperative that all the topics exhibit a direct influence or involvement of an artist.
</p>
<p>Our initiative is designed to help both artists and industry professionals navigate the complexities of the music business while promoting a dialogue about an ethical and moral framework that could guide industry practices. We acknowledge that the music industry is, at its core, a business driven by profit, and we are fully supportive of artists and businesses making money. However, we believe that profitability and ethics can and should coexist.</p>
<p>
We support everyone in making music, following their ambitions, and expressing their feelings through music. There is no clear boundary where making music becomes the “music industry”, but at some point, you can't do it all yourself. You need a venue to perform, your fans need an app to play your music, and you might need a label to clear sample, or a publisher draw up a sync-license. For these businesses to operate, they require employees and cover costs. Since you are creating a partnership in all kinds of forms it is very valuable to understand perspective these businesses have on certain topics. What motivates them to put certain things in a contract, and what is generally accepted as the norm. Which often varies per country.
</p><p>
It’s crucial to recognize that there are different phases in a career, and business. Depending on the current phase, the value brought to a partnership will vary. The majority of the time, the track record of the involved parties determines the leverage they bring to the negotiation table. We want to remove the knowledge advantage that industry professionals generally have. This creates a partnership with an informed artist en recognizes the executional experience and connections of the industry professional. 
We are of the opinion that an informed partner is more valuable to a relationship. Which is why we created Music Morals. 
</p><p>
Our mission is to establish a framework for what constitutes moral and ethical behavior in the music industry. And offer insight into the thinking of your potential partner from a business perspective. We understand that the world is constantly changing, and the music industry is always evolving. We are not aiming to be the most forward-thinking or disruptive force; instead, we believe that education and a clear framework are the way forward for everyone. Futhermore, we see it as our role to present the different business perspectives on the same topic and ensure their arguments are made on an equal basis. To have an honest conversation about morals and ethics in the music industry, we must establish a baseline of current practices while being mindful of the different perspectives on these topics.
</p><p>
At this moment, we are actively engaging with artists, promoters, agents, managers, labels, publishers, and entertainment lawyers to determine what the current perspectives on different topics are. Our goal is to present these perspectives without disclosing who provided the input. With this approach we hope to create understanding of the other side's reasoning. We want a continued dialogue with all relevant participants while protecting their anonymity, allowing their true perspectives to be represented without fear of reprisal. This balance of transparency and comprehensive representation is critical. Disclosing sources might discourage honest input from individuals fearing job loss, business owners wary of social repercussions, and artists concerned about their careers. Of course we are very appreciative towards industry professionals, and artist if they publicly disclose they provided us with input, support or a donation. This raises awareness, and creates transparancy.
</p><p>
By providing a balanced, long-form perspective from all sides involved, Music Morals aims to enhance understanding of the actual drivers behind industry decisions, beyond PR statements and social media stances. We believe that to improve the industry, we must appreciate the real perspectives that influence decision-making.
</p><p>
Our focus remains steadfastly on the business side of the music industry. While we are aware of the deep connection between culture and music, we consciously choose to stay away from cultural, political, and social topics or activism. These discussions, though related to music, need to be worked out in society. We aim to steer clear of opinions on the 'current thing' and remain dedicated to our core mission.
</p><p>
Currently, we are working behind the scenes on multiple initiatives. To name a few:
<ul>
    <li>Engaging with industry professionals such as artists, label executives, publishers, collective rights organizations, and other non-profit organizations.</li>
    <li>How to practically present the different perspectives on multiple topics in the most neutral way on our website.</li>
    <li>We will be releasing topics in phases to gather comprehensive input on each.</li>
    <li>We are currently seeking input on what technical approach would be the best approach to streamline this process, and maintain scalability.</li>
    <li>Working out the details of creating a support badge that industry professionals can present on, for example, their website. As a way to signal they support the Music Morals framework</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our current thinking is to approach all topics from three stages in their artist career or business level, Aspiring, Upcoming, and Established. We are working with the assumption that the majority of parties will work with another party that is at least on the same level, or one level separated. Of course we can name the exceptions ourselves, but for the sake of structure, we need to generalize. A newly founded agency is unlikely to be working exclusively with an established artist. Just as, an artist with a small catalog is not very likely to be working with an established publisher,
We hope to achieve some clarity with this approach. An additional benefit is, since all perspectives are public, you can learn from them and adjust based on new insights.
</p><p>
Since we want to release the topics in phases, we want to invite the public to suggest what topics we need to discuss in the next phase. We are currently taking suggestions for phase one. Based on the input we receive we will determine the most relevant topics for this phase.
</p><p>
To ensure we are moving forward, no entity or party other than Music Morals wil have a right to claim adjustment or removal of a perspective. All expressed perspectives are a derivatives from actual statements, and there will be no directly tracable parties or cases. We take suggestions on how to change, add, or improve. If you have a different view that isn't represented, please send us a well-thought-out email. If your view is well substantiated and widely supported, we will consider adding it or amending the current text.
</p><p>
Please let us know, in a constructive manner, if you disagree with us or a perspective on the website. This way, we can reflect and adjust when and where we deem it necessary. If the outcome still isn't what you want, or you don't feel represented, please use a public forum where others can weigh in and comment. <BR>Most of us grew up on the internet, so we know that the limited characters in a comment section might not be the best place to convince people to change their minds. Trolling and strong opinions, held weakly, are a fun and core part of the current online social environment. But we would strongly suggest to construct well-substantiated arguments, if you are actually looking to improve the current way the music industry works.
</p><p>
Join us on this important journey as we open up a dialogue about the morals and ethics of the business side of music, working towards a future where the majority of the industry operates on a foundation of integrity and mutual respect.<BR>
</p><p>
We are in the early stages of this initiative and welcome all the value you can add. We are exploring to set up a foundation in the Netherlands to formalize this initiative. We will operate MusicMorals.com as a value for value project. Which means; if you get any value out of the information we provide. Consider giving value back to the foundation by donating your time, talent, or treasure. We chose this model, because we see it as the only way to operate independently, with total freedom and openness, and without the risk of self-censorship. We really appreciate your input, connection, and donation. Let's create Music Morals together!
