<h1>Introduction to Music Morals</h1>

<p>
Music Morals aims to explore and amplify the often-overlooked aspects of the music business, fees, percentages, terms, copyright, contracts, deal structures, and revenue splits. Our initiative is designed to help both artists and industry professionals navigate the complexities of the music business while promoting a dialogue about the ethical and moral standards that should guide industry practices. We acknowledge that the music industry is, at its core, a business driven by profit, and we are fully supportive of artists and businesses making money. However, we believe that profitability and ethics can and should coexist.</p>
<p>
We support everyone in making music, following their ambitions, and expressing their feelings through music. There is no clear boundary where making music becomes an “industry,” but at some point, you can't do it all yourself. You need a venue to perform, your fans need an app to play your music, and you need a studio to record. These locations, platforms, and spaces are invaluable to artists, and for them to operate, they require employees and cover costs. This is where music becomes a business and you, as an artist, need to function as a business to operate within the current system.
</p><p>
While you can accomplish a lot on your own, other people with more experience and connections can add significant value. It’s crucial to recognize that there are different phases to the value each party can bring to another. Although this is subjective, and exceptional talent can sometimes shift these dynamics, the majority of the time, the track record of the involved party determines the leverage they bring to the negotiation table.
</p><p>
Our mission is to establish a clear standard of what constitutes moral and ethical behavior in the music industry. We understand that the world is constantly changing, and the music industry is always evolving. We are not aiming to be the most forward-thinking or disruptive force; instead, we believe that education and clear standards are the way forward for everyone. To have an honest conversation about morals and ethics in the music industry, we must establish a baseline of current practices while being mindful of the different perspectives on these topics.
</p><p>
At this moment, we are actively engaging with artists, promoters, agents, managers, labels, publishers, and entertainment lawyers to determine how best to present these standards. Our goal is to find common ground without disclosing who provides input. This approach ensures a continued dialogue with all relevant participants while protecting their anonymity, allowing their true perspectives to be represented without fear of reprisal. This balance of transparency and comprehensive representation is critical. Disclosing sources might discourage honest input from individuals fearing job loss, business owners wary of social repercussions, and artists concerned about their careers.
</p><p>
By providing a balanced, long-form perspective from all sides involved, Music Morals aims to enhance understanding of the actual drivers behind industry decisions, beyond PR statements and social media stances. We believe that to improve the industry, we must appreciate the real perspectives that influence decision-making.
</p><p>
Our focus remains steadfastly on the business side of the music industry. While we are aware of the deep connection between culture and music, we consciously choose to stay away from cultural, political, and social topics or activism. These discussions, though related to music, need to be worked out in society. We aim to steer clear of opinions on the 'current thing' and remain dedicated to our core mission.
</p><p>
Currently, we are working behind the scenes on multiple initiatives. To name a few:
<ul>
    <li>Engaging with industry professionals such as artists, label executives, publishers, collective rights organizations, and other non-profit organizations.</li>
    <li>How to practically present the different perspectives on multiple topics in the most neutral way on our website.</li>
    <li>We will be releasing topics in phases to gather comprehensive input on each.</li>
    <li>We are currently seeking input on what technical approach would be the best approach to streamline this process, and maintain scalability.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our current thinking is to approach all topics from three stages in their respective careers. Aspiring, Upcoming, and Established. We think these descriptors can provide structure and perspective. We are working with the assumption that the majority of parties will work with another party that is at least on the same level, or one level separated. Perhaps we can name the exceptions ourselves, but for the sake of progress, we need generalization. All with the argument that one party is of value to the other because of growth or opportunities. A newly founded agency is unlikely to be working exclusively with an established artist. Just as, an artist with a small catalog is not very likely to be working with an established publisher,
We hope to achieve some clarity with this approach. Since all perspectives are public, you can learn from them and figure out how to get there.
</p><p>
We also want to open up the phases to the public, inviting you to vote on what topics we need to discuss in the next phase. We are aware that opening the phases up to the public introduces the possibility of “gaming” the system. That is why it is ultimately up to us at MusicMorals.com to decide what we present as part of our suggestions for standard business practices.
</p><p>
To ensure we are moving forward, the ultimate text of the different perspectives we describe will be decided by us. We will take suggestions on how to change, add, or improve. If you have a different view that isn't represented, please send us a well-thought-out email. If your view is well substantiated and widely supported, we will consider adding it or amending the current text.
</p><p>
Entitlement is another topic that we want to bring up. This exists on many levels within the music industry. We acknowledge this in advance because we believe this is where reflection can start. This phenomenon can surface in various forms. Our take is that everyone is free to operate as they choose. Our role is to present the different perspectives that exist in the music industry on the business side and ensure their arguments are made on an equal basis. Then, we aim to establish a framework that can be used as a reference for specific topics.
</p><p>
If you don’t agree with the decisions we make, please let us know in a constructive manner. This way, we can reflect and adjust when and where we deem it necessary. If the outcome still isn't what you want, or you don't feel represented, please use a public forum where others can weigh in and comment. Most of us grew up on the internet, so we know that the limited characters in a comment section might not be the best place to convince people to change their minds. Trolling and strong opinions that are weakly held are a fun and core part of the culture. We would like change to happen because of well-substantiated arguments, not because of loud voices or individuals directing their loyal followers to advocate for change.
</p><p>
Join us on this important journey as we open up a dialogue about the morals and ethics of the business side of music, working towards a future where the industry operates on a foundation of integrity and mutual respect.
</p><p>
We are in the early stages of this initiative and welcome all the value you can add. We are exploring the requirements to set up a foundation in the Netherlands to house this initiative. Our goal is to operate MusicMorals.com as a value for value project. It comes down to; if you get any value out of the information we provide. Consider giving value back to the foundation by donating your time, talent, or treasure.
We chose this model, because we see this as the only way to operate independently, with total freedom and openness, and without the risk of self-censorship. We really appreciate your input, connection, and donation. Lets create Music Morals together!
</p><p>
We look forward to hearing from you at info@musicmorals.com, and keep an eye on musicmorals.com for the latest developments.
